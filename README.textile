h1. CKI Member List Custom Field

*ft.cki_mblist.php*

This is an EE2.0 custom field type that will add a drop down list of all your site members to your ExpressionEngine publish form.  When displaying the field in your ExpressionEngine templates the custom field tag will allow you to retrieve any information stored for that member, such as Email, Screen name, Member ID, Member group name etc.

h2. Info

Developed by Christopher Imrie, "http://www.christopherimrie.com":url<br/>
This field type is inspired by LG Member list ("http://leevigraham.com/cms-customisation/expressionengine/lg-member-list/":url)<br/>

h2. Requirements

* ExpressionEngine 2.0

h2. Installation

* Copy the <code>cki_mblist</code> folder to your <code>system/expressionengine/third_party/</code> folder.<br/>
* Go to Add-ons -> Fieldtypes in the ExpressionEngine control panel and install the fieldtype labelled 'CKI Member List'
* Select *CKI Member List* as the field type when creating a new custom field type

h2. How to use

The field type supports single tag and tag pairs, depending on whether you want more than one element of member data at any one time.

The member_id of the selected member can be produced by simply using the Field name of your custom field with no parameters.  If you want to retrieve a specific item of member data, you can use the <code>get</code> parameter to specify what data you want returned.

h3. Simple Example

Lets say you have defined a custom field with a field label of *Member_list* and field name *member_list* and through the publish form selected a member with an ID of 3.  You can produce the Member ID of the selected member by simply calling the field name tag on its own:

<pre>
	<code>
		{exp:channel:entries channel="blog"}
			<p>You selected member ID {member_list}</p>
		{/exp:channel:entries}
	</code>
</pre>

*Returns:*
<pre>
	<code><p>You selected member ID 3</p></code>
</pre>

h3. Parameter Example

Using the same member you have selected in the above example, we can retrieve this member's email address by using the <code>show</code> parameter:

<pre>
	<code>
		{exp:channel:entries channel="blog"}
			<p>You selected member email is {member_list show="email"}</p>
		{/exp:channel:entries}
	</code>
</pre>

*Returns:*
<pre>
	<code><p>Your selected member email is john@smith.com</p></code>
</pre>
